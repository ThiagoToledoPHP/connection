# Connection Class
PHP Class for connection to MySql database using mysqli.

It has tests in PHPUnit (Main methods), treatment with different versions of PHP, exception handling and custom output errors to Debug.


**Example 1 - Silent mode:**
    
        //Set a connections strings host, user, pass and DBname and set the Silent mode for errors
        $connection = new Connection("DbHost","DbUser","DbPass","DbName");
        
        //Start a connection
        $connection->start();
        
        //Execute a Query
        $connection->executeQuery("Select * from cliente");
        
        //Fecth a array of objects
        $ResultSetFetchArrayObjects = $connection->getResultSetFetchArrayObjects();
        
        //Stop the connection
        $connection->stop();
        
        //Save errors to Log. Example of hipotetic Log class
        $myLog->save($connection->getErrorMsg() . " - " . $connection->getErrorNumber());


**Example 2 - Exception mode (create a exception in errors):**

    //...
