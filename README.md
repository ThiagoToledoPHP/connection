        //Start a connection
        $connection->start();

        $connection->executeQuery("Select * from cliente");
        
        //Fecth a array of objects
        $ResultSetFetchArrayObjects = $connection->getResultSetFetchArrayObjects();
        
        //Stop the connection
        $connection->stop();
        
        //Save errors to Log. Example of hipotetic Log class
